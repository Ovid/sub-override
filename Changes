      Remembered to update Changes file.  Grr.  I really need a
      "lint" script which can check to see if I've forgotten
      stupid things.

0.07  Wed Sep 21 2005
      Added dependency on Sub::Uplevel even though I don't use
      it.  Tests keep failing for folks because of it.
      Added pod tests.
      Added "override" as a synonym for "replace".

    - Ensure that restore() always restores the sub to its
      original state.  This allows a subroutine to be safely
      overridden multiple times.

0.05  Tue Aug 24 2004
    - Removed accidental dependency on Data::Dumper::Simple
      
0.04  Mon Aug 23 2004
    - Fixed bug where explicitly restoring subs whose names were
      not fully qualified would fail.
